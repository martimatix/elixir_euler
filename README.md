# Project Euler Elixir

There are my solutions to the first ten mathematical problems of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) using [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/). It's something I like to do when I'm learning a new language. The best thing to do is to give it a go yourself and then look at other people's solutions.

With that in mind, please note that this is a beginner's code and may not reflect Elixir best practices.

## Initial impressions of Elixir
Being a Ruby on Rails dev, I feel at home with the syntax since Ruby and Elixir look quite similar. Pattern matching in Elixir makes it easier to write functional code than in Ruby or Javascript. Speaking of which, functional programming is fun once you get into it! :smiley:

## Where to from here?
I intend to learn more about the [Pheonix](http://www.phoenixframework.org/) framework.
